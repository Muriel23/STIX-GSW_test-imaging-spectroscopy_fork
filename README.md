# STIX-GSW for testing Imaging - Spectroscopy

This repository is for testing the STIX imaging-spectroscopy software: Once extensive testing is performed, we can merge it to the official [STIX-GSW](https://github.com/i4Ds/STIX-GSW).

In order to know how to run the imaging spectroscopy software, we refer to the pdf document as well as the `demo_imaging_spectroscopy.pro` procedure in the `imaging-spectroscopy_temporary-folder` folder.
